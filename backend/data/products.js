      "There is much more to the Dean USA Icon Flametop than its understated good looks. The guitar is crafted from high-quality materials, including an attractive carved, arched flame-maple top, tight-grained mahogany body and neck and an ebony fingerboard that's smooth as a marble table top. The hardware is of similar high quality, boasting USA DMT Custom humbuckers and satin nickel hardware. A single layer of wood binding surrounding the maple top adds to the Icon's classy appearance.",

      'Kiko plays a wide range of music, from metal to jazz fusion, and the pickups were designed to reflect this range of sound. The neck and bridge pickups both humbuckers have medium output and a balanced sound in terms of frequency response. The single-coil middle pickup is more powerful and warmer-sounding than a typical vintage single-coil, in order to balance well with the neck and bridge pickups.',
